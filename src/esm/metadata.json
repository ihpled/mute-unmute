  "description": "This extension allows muting/unmuting volume output/input by middle-clicking the speaker/mic icon on the menu bar. This extension uses mute/unmute API in order to restore previous volume level after unmuting.\nFor Gnome 43 and previous versions it supports only muting/unmuting volume output but it adds also the same behaviour of Gnome 44 and later versions: mute/unmute audio by clicking the audio output icon next to the volume slider",
