  "description": "This extension allows muting/unmuting audio by middle-clicking the speaker icon on the menu bar. It also ports on Gnome 43 and previous versions the same behaviour of Gnome 44 and later versions: mute/unmute audio by clicking the audio output icon next to the volume slider. This extension uses mute/unmute API in order to restore previous volume level after unmuting.",
